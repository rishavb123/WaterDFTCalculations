 - I'm Rishav Bhagat and I will be talking about calculating the reaction energies of the 
   2H20 --> 2H2 + O2

- Before we dive into the code, I'd like to discuss some of the building blocks that allowed us
  to write this simple script to do something as complicated as calculating the reaction energy
  of a reaction.

- At a conceptual level . . . 
	Basic chemistry concepts --> atoms, molecules, reactions
	Understand what DFT is doing even if we do not understand how
		Solving Schrodinger's equation using various approximations for complex systems
- From the software development setup side of things . . . 
	Python
	Linux Operating System
	PACE Supercomputer
	Environment Setup with Libraries as Shreya talked about
	Login with SSH / File Transfer through SFTP
    
- And of cource, we are dependent on the ASE and SPARCH libraries
	I won't go into too much detail into these libraries since Yi has already mentioned them,
	but at a surface level, the ASE library allows us to represent chemical particles like 
	atoms and molecules as software objects and the SPARC library gives us an interface to 
	perform Density Functional Theory calculations without actually having to code in all
	the required math.

- Now diving into the code and a quick demo of the code
